## Overview

Enpiction is an application to hide secret data which should be
grouped together (such as a website name, username, and password) within 
images on a device. Enpiction operates similar to an encrypted data store by 
encrypting the data prior to storing it. In this case, the data is not stored 
in a centralized, known (to almost any user) location, but rather distributed 
among image files across the device. This technique should also help users 
remember the location of their data by associating data groups with certain 
images.
